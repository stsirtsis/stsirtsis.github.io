üëãüèº **Hey there!** My name is Stratis, and I am a postdoc at the [Hasso Plattner Institute](https://hpi.de/en/) working with [Sandra Wachter](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/sandra-wachter/). My research focuses primarily on algorithmic problems surrounding the social impact of artificial intelligence.

I did my PhD in computer science at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) advised by [Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/). During my PhD, I interned at [Meta (FAIR)](https://ai.meta.com/) and spent 3 months at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) working with [Tobias Gerstenberg](https://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/). Before that, I studied electrical & computer engineering at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://ntua.gr/en/), where I completed my diploma thesis supervised by [Dimitris Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/).

My work spans a wide range of topics including the study of incentives in markets of generative AI, the development of AI systems to assist human decisions, as well as explainability and fairness. At a technical level, it is based on **game theory**, **causality**, and **optimization**. If you find these topics interesting, feel free to reach out!
