üëãüèº **Hey there!** I am Stratis, and I am currently pursuing a PhD in computer science, fortunate to be advised by [Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/).
I have spent fall 2023 as a research intern at [Meta AI (FAIR)](https://ai.meta.com/) and spring 2023 as a visitor at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) working with [Tobias Gerstenberg](https://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/).
<!--  -->
Before starting my PhD, I studied electrical & computer engineering at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://ntua.gr/en/), where I completed my diploma thesis supervised by [Dimitris Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/).

At a high level, I am interested in building AI systems to understand, inform and complement human decisions and judgments in uncertain and high-stakes environments. During my PhD, I have focused primarily on developing **machine learning** methods for (i) decision making in the presence of strategic human behavior and (ii) counterfactual analysis of sequential decision-making tasks. In a nutshell, my **research interests** lie in the intersection of machine learning and:
* causal inference
* game theory
* combinatorial & convex optimization
* algorithmic fairness
* computational cognitive science
