üëãüèº **Hey there!** My name is Stratis, and I am currently pursuing a PhD in computer science, fortunate to be advised by [Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/).
I have spent fall 2023 as a research intern at [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/) and spring 2023 as a visitor at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) working with [Tobias Gerstenberg](https://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/).
<!--  -->
Before starting my PhD, I studied electrical & computer engineering at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://ntua.gr/en/), where I completed my diploma thesis supervised by [Dimitris Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/).

To put it shortly, my **research insterests** are in the field of **machine learning** and especially in its ties with the following areas:
* Causality
* Game theory
* Fairness
* Explainability
* Optimization

**TBD**
<!--  -->
More specifically, my research is focused on the design of data-driven models and algorithms to inform human decisions in uncertain and high-stakes environments.
<!--  -->
During my PhD, I have worked on (i) and (ii). 
<!--  -->
For additional details and other things I have worked on, have a look at my list of [publications](/al-folio/publications/).
