trivia: I grew up on a beautiful Greek island called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY2RUJdH2Is">Lesvos</a>. Even though my name is rare in Greece, on the island there is a Stratis in every second house. The correct way to pronounce it is "Strah-tee-s", like in  "stra(tegy)", "tee(th)", and "c(ereal)".

üëãüèº **Hey there!** I am Stratis, and I am currently pursuing a PhD in computer science, fortunate to be advised by [Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/).
I have spent fall 2023 as a research intern at [Meta AI (FAIR)](https://ai.meta.com/) and spring 2023 as a visitor at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) working with [Tobias Gerstenberg](https://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/).
<!--  -->
Before starting my PhD, I studied electrical & computer engineering at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://ntua.gr/en/), where I completed my diploma thesis supervised by [Dimitris Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/).

In a nutshell, my **research interests** lie in the intersection of **machine learning** and:
* causality
* game theory
* fairness
* optimization
* cognitive science

More specifically, I am interested in designing models and algorithms based on machine learning to inform human decisions in high-stakes environments. Throughout my PhD, I have worked.
