üëãüèº **Hey there!** My name is Stratis, and I am a postdoc at the [Hasso Plattner Institute](https://hpi.de/en/) working with [Sandra Wachter](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/sandra-wachter/). My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, economics, and cognitive science, and focuses primarily on algorithmic problems surrounding the social impact of artificial intelligence.

I did my PhD in computer science at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) advised by [Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/). During that time, I was fortunate enough to spend 3 months as a research intern at [Meta (FAIR)](https://ai.meta.com/) and 3 months as a visitor at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) hosted by [Tobias Gerstenberg](https://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/). Even earlier, I studied electrical & computer engineering at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://ntua.gr/en/), where I completed my diploma thesis supervised by [Dimitris Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/).

My work spans a wide range of topics including the study of incentives in AI-assisted decision making and in markets of generative AI, the role of AI in assisting human decisions, as well as issues of explainability and fairness. At a technical level, it is mostly based on **causality**, **game theory**, and **optimization**. If you find these topics interesting, feel free to reach out!
