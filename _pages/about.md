üëãüèº **Hey there!** My name is Stratis, and I recently completed my PhD at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) advised by [Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/). Starting in October, I am excited to be joining the [Hasso Plattner Institute](https://hpi.de/en/), working as a postdoctoral researcher with [Sandra Wachter](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/sandra-wachter/).

During my PhD, I was fortunate to spend 3 months as a research intern at [Meta (FAIR)](https://ai.meta.com/) and 3 months as a visitor at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) working with [Tobias Gerstenberg](https://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/). Before starting my PhD, I studied electrical & computer engineering at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://ntua.gr/en/), where I completed my diploma thesis supervised by [Dimitris Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/).

My research interests are primarily related to the social aspects of artificial intelligence and computing. More specifically, my work lies at the intersection of *machine learning* with *economics* and *cognitive science* and, at a technical level, it is based on *causality*, *game theory*, and *optimization*. If you find these topics interesting, feel free to reach out!
